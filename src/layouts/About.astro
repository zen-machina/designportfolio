            <p class="indent-8 mb-10">
                Hi there! I'm Armando Alvarez, your go-to guy for graphic design
                and web development. My journey in the design world began at an
                exciting startup, where for 6 years, I got to play a key role in
                creating cool cycling and triathlon apparel. I started out
                getting my hands dirty with graphic and production design, and
                eventually stepped up as Art Director, leading some pretty
                fantastic teams along the way.
            </p>

            <p class="indent-8 mb-10">
                After soaking up tons of experience, I decided to ride solo and
                dove into freelancing. This gave me the chance to balance my
                love for graphic design with my growing interest in web
                development. Fast forward a bit, and now I'm running my own
                show, helping small businesses make a big impact with custom web
                designs, branding, and more. And hey, this website you're
                checking out? Yep, it's one of my creations!
            </p>

            <p class="indent-8 mb-10">
                Outside of work, I'm just a dad to two amazing boys, a snowboard
                enthusiast, and a bit of a movie buff. I like to think of myself
                as a team player who's easy to get along with, always up for a
                challenge, and keen on keeping things creative and fun. So
                whether I'm brainstorming the next project or drawing up
                designs, I believe in mixing professional expertise with a
                personal touch.
